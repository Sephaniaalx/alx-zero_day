in the Linux command line, you can modify your Git configuration by adding a pre-push hook. A pre-push hook is a script that is executed before the push operation occurs, allowing you to perform checks and validations.

Follow these steps to create a pre-push hook that prevents pushing changes to a branch containing ~ in the Linux command line:

Navigate to the Git repository's local directory using the command line.
Inside the repository, go to the .git directory.
Open the hooks directory.
